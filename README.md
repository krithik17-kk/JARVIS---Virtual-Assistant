JARVIS - Virtual Assistant

-Overview :

JARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a web-based Virtual Assistant inspired by the AI system from popular culture. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, JARVIS is designed to handle simple user commands and provide intelligent responses in real-time. This project showcases the fundamental concepts of building a virtual assistant with web technologies and can serve as a foundation for more complex AI-powered assistants.

-Features :

Real-Time Interaction: Responds instantly to user queries and commands.

Voice Integration: Allows speech input/output for a more interactive experience (optional based on browser support).

Predefined Commands: Handles basic commands such as greetings, time, weather (static), and more.

Dynamic Responses: Provides responses based on user input using JavaScript logic.

Customizable: Easily extendable to handle more commands and complex logic.

-Technologies Used :

HTML5: Used for structuring the web page and interface.

CSS3: For styling the layout, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive design.

JavaScript: Powers the core functionality, handling user input and generating responses dynamically.

-How It Works :

The user can type or speak commands into the input field.

JARVIS processes the input and returns a response based on predefined logic.

The responses include basic tasks such as :

Greeting the user

Providing the current time (using JavaScript's Date object)

Displaying static information such as weather or basic facts

Simple conversational replies
